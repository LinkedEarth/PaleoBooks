PaleoBooks is a compendium of digital resources to bridge the gap between paleoclimate observations and models, and between past, present and future. The goal is as much to encourage adoption of open-source, free languages like R and Python by the observational paleoscience community as it is to encourage the modeling community to leverage the unique information coming from paleo archives.

The scholarly objects shown below are of several types:

* Tutorials on how to overcome a particular technical difficulty (“Life Hacks”)
* Tutorials on how to leverage open-source code to achieve easier, more transparent, or more powerful scientific workflows (“Science Bits”)
* Examples of novel paleoscience using the Python ecosystem e.g. as turn-key supplementary material from recent publications (“Papers”)

In the following, “PaleoBooks” refers to curated collections of Jupyter Notebooks organized around various themes. “Chapters” refers to the components of these PaleoBooks. A system of tags allows both PaleoBooks and individual chapters to be associated with one another based on individual themes or methodologies, in addition to their host PaleoBook. These tags enable searching along 3 directions:

* “Domains” refers to scientific themes or methodologies
* “Formats” refers to the type of resource (Life Hacks, Science Bits, or Papers)
* “Packages” refers to the packages being used in each notebook (e.g. Xarray)

The gallery below is a work in progress, and we encourage you to :ref:`contribute<contributor-guide>` your own analyses if you think they might bring enlightenment to, and/or ease the life of, fellow scientists.
